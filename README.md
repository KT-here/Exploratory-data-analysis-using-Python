# Exploratory-data-analysis-using-Python
My first python EDA project using Superstore data
The goal of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Superstore dataset to uncover insights and patterns related to order and Profit. By analyzing various features and their relationships with prices, we aim to identify key factors that influence pricing, detect anomalies, and summarize the main characteristics of the data.
